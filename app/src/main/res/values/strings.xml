        The Thirteenth Doctor is the current incarnation of the Doctor, the fictional protagonist of the
        BBC science fiction television programme Doctor Who. She is portrayed by English actress Jodie Whittaker,
        the first woman to portray the character in the series.
        \n\n
        In the show\'s narrative, the Doctor is a time travelling,
        humanoid alien from a race known as "the Time Lords". To account for actors\' departure from the series, the
        programme introduced the narrative concept of regeneration, a means for a Time Lord to gain a new appearance and
        a distinct new personality when the Doctor approaches the end of the current incarnation.
        \n\n
        Whittaker appeared for the first time as the Thirteenth Doctor at the end of the 2017 Christmas special, "Twice Upon a Time",
        and stars as the Doctor from 2018, starting with the programme\'s eleventh series.
